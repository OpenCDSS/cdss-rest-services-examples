# examples/arcgis

This folder contains examples of how to link ArcGIS to the State of Colorado's HydroBase REST web services.

The initial project did not provide enough funding to develop full ArcGIS examples.
However, the other examples can be used as follows:

* If developing a web application using ArcGIS technologies, see the JavaScript examples.
* If developing a desktop application using Python, see the Python examples.
