# examples/javascript

This folder contains examples of how to link JavaScript (web applications) to the State of Colorado's HydroBase REST web services.

The State of Colorado has done preliminary work to automate creation of a JavaScript API library
that provides basic access and visualization of web services.
This API will be evaluated, documented, and made available to streamline use of the web services
and implement automated tests.
Use of the API library will ensure that this code does not have to be redeveloped and that the API
is consistent with the server-side web services.

See also the example on the [HydroBase REST Web Services website](https://dwr.state.co.us/Rest/GET/Help#TechInfoHelp&#All&#gettingstarted&#jsonxml).
